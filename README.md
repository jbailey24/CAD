In this assignment, I followed the Introduction to SolidWorks tutorial, where I made a pressure plate.

I didn't encounter any difficulties because this was a very basic tutorial, but it was a good refresher after not working with SolidWorks for a while.

In this assignment, I followed the Lofts SolidWorks tutorial, where I made a head of a hammer.

This assignment was also fairly straightforward. The only minor dificulty was using the flex tool, but after a few minutes of playing around with it, I was able to understand what to do.

In this assignment, I followed the Revolves and Sweeps SolidWorks tutorial, where I made a simple candlestick.

I had some fun in this assignment playing around with the texture and color tools. 

## Intro to Assemblies
### Part 1

In this assignment, I followed the Lesson 1: Parts SolidWorks tutorial.

While I found this assignment unchallenging, I had never used the shell tool before, so it was interesting to learn something new.

### Part 2

In this assignment, I followed the first half of the Lesson 2: Assemblies SolidWorks tutorial.

This part of the assignment isn't meant to teach you anything new, just to be an object to make an assembly with in the next assignment, so I found it to be very quick and easy.

In this assignment, I followed the second half of the Lesson 2: Assemblies SolidWorks tutorial, where I made a quick little assembly.

I did not have any issues with this assignment, but I found that it helped jog my memories on how to make more complecated assemblies.
