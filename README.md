In this assignment, I followed the Introduction to SolidWorks tutorial, where I made a pressure plate.

I didn't encounter any difficulties because this was a very basic tutorial, but it was a good refresher after not working with SolidWorks for a while.

In this assignment, I followed the Lofts SolidWorks tutorial, where I made a head of a hammer.

This assignment was also fairly straightforward. The only minor dificulty was using the flex tool, but after a few minutes of playing around with it, I was able to understand what to do.

In this assignment, I followed the Revolves and Sweeps SolidWorks tutorial, where I made a simple candlestick.

I didn't have any issues with this assignment other then applying textures and color, which was not necessary to complete it.
